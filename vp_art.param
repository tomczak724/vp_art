###  STEPS TO PERFORM (y/n):

BIAS_COMBINE   y       #  Create master bias stack
COMP_COMBINE   y       #  Create master comp stack
FLAT_COMBINE   y       #  Create master flat stack
BIAS_SUBTRACT  y       #  Perform bias subtraction
FIBER_TRACE    y       #  Trace fibers 
LAMBDA_SOLVE   y       #  Calculate wavelength solution
COSMIC_RAYS    n       #  Generate cosmic ray masks
SKY_SUBTRACT   n       #  Perform sky subtraction
WRITE_SPECTRA  y       #  Write data files for spectra


FIBERS_TOTAL	246	    #  Total number of fibers (including dead and such)
FIBERS_EXCLUDE	1,2,3,121   #  Fibers that need to be excluded if either
			    #  dead or off the chip. Fibers are counted
			    #  from the bottom of the image up as 1,2,3...
			    #  Ex: if fibers 10 & 251 are dead
			    #      FIBERS_EXCLUDE  10,251

FIBER_WIDTH	5       #  Relavent fiber width in pixels
FIBER_SEP	8       #  Approximate fiber separation in pixels
LO_BUFFER       8       #  Pixel-length from the bottom to ignore in fiber search in col 0
HI_BUFFER       8       #  Pixel-length from the top to ignore in fiber search in col 0


LINE_LIST      lines.dat  #  File containing line wavelengths for comp frames
COMP_HEADER    OBJECT     #  Header entry designating proper comp type
COMP_NAME      NeCd       #  Proper comp type to use
POLYFIT_ORDER  4          #  Order of the polynomial fit for the wavelength solution

CR_SCAN_DX     3          #  Number of pixels to use on either side when identifying cosmic rays
